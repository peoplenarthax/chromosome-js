## How to help documenting

Do you know about Genetic Algorithms and want to explain some concept? Are you eager to help us improve the language that we use? Do you have any doubt or something that we could make clearer? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/peoplenarthax/chromosome-js/issues) starting with ```[Documentation]```

Once you have started with the issue the next steps if you want to add something or update it in the existing documentation:

- Fork the repo ([How to fork the repo?](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo))
- Add / Update the files that exist within the `docs` directory.
- Create a Pull Request

#### Utils

You can help ChromosomeJS to extend the utils functions library, define a better API to interact with it or simply make a feature request. Just open an issue starting with ```[Utils]```.

#### Framework

To help ChromosomeJS offer a more performant framework, improve the API, extend it to fit other Evolutionary Algorithms you could start by opening an issue starting with ```[Framework]```.

### Submitting a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We donâ€™t want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we wonâ€™t want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation *is* to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

1. Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/peoplenarthax/chromosome-js/issues)
1. Fork the repo
1. Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch
1. Create breaking test(s) before implementing any fixes or functionality
1. Make your changes
1. Submit a pull request, referencing any issue that it resolves
